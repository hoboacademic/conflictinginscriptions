I have chosen to use Github Pages to host a blog site for a number of reasons which span avoiding annoying pop-ups to Github just being an interesting space.  The primary motivation though is that I want this tiny bit of bandwidth and bytes to be a little bit more of a collaborative and interactive space than most blog hosting sites provide.  I think it's pretty boring to just read and click like or type a comment.   As a result this site has been designed to be a work in progress on purpose.  If you want to engage more with the content or have suggestions/questions click the Github widget on the left and you will be directed to the Discussions section of the repository used to build this website.  You will need a Github account or to create one though.
