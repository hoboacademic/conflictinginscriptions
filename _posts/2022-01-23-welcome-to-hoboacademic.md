I have chosen to use Github Pages to host a blog site relating broadly to my PhD for a wide variety of reasons.  The primary motivation though is that I want this tiny bit of bandwidth and bytes to be a little bit more of a collaborative and interactive space than most third-party blog hosting sites provide.  I think it's pretty boring to just read a post, click like or type a comment.   As a result this site has been designed to be a work in progress on purpose.  I'm not a programming boffin or an expert in web design, this is my first attemtpt at a web page.  I'm interested in geospatial technology, how it used, why it is used and its impacts (the brilliant, the good, the not so good and the awful). I know some of the ways you can wrangle geospatial data.  It was wanting to learn more about visualisng complex geospatial data that led me to Github initially. 

So, if you want to engage more with the content or have suggestions/questions click the Github widget on the left and you will be directed to the Discussions section of the repository used to build this website. You can also have a poke around and look at the 'repo' or the code and templates which have been used to create the website. You can't really break it, so have a look at the change history.  Some things have taken a few trials.  You will need a Github acccount (or create one) to engage with the repo discussion,  comment or suggest changes.
