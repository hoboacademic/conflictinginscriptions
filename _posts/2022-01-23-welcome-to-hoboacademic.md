I have chosen to use Github Pages to host a blog site relating broadly to my PhD topic for a wide variety of reasons spanning from avoiding annoying pop-ups to Github just being an interesting space.  The primary motivation though is that I want this tiny bit of bandwidth and bytes to be a little bit more of a collaborative and interactive space than most third-party blog hosting sites provide.  I think it's pretty boring to just read a post, click like or type a comment.   

As a result this site has been designed to be a work in progress on purpose.  I'm not a programming boffin or an expert in web design, this is my first attemtpt at a web page.  I'm interested in geospatial technology and know how to wrangle geospatial data which is how I came to be introduced to Github. If you want to engage more with the content or have suggestions/questions click the Github widget on the left and you will be directed to the Discussions section of the repository used to build this website. You can also have a poke around and look at the 'repo' or the code and templates which have been used to create the website. You can't really break it, so have a look at the changes history etc.  You will need a Github acccount (or create one) to comment or suggest changes.
