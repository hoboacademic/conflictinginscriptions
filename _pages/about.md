A space for conflicting and often conflicted inscriptions which relate to academic geography broadly and geospatial technology more specifically. Yes, it is yet another blog where the ups and downs of research relating to geography are inscribed. Currently this website is as much about teaching myself some more program markdown language as it is publishing thoughts about geospatial technology and the academic discipline of geography.  Also hoping to release a podcast in early 2021.
